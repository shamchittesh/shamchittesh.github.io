## AutoScalable Spring Boot App - EC2, Nginx, Terraform, Ansible

In this #100DaysDevopChallenge; We will create a dynamic Spring Boot backend image, use it as a launch template for an EC2 Auto Scaling group, and configure Nginx as the load balancer (handling rate-limiting and load balancing) instead of AWS LB. The entire setup will be automated and provisioned using Terraform and Ansible.
